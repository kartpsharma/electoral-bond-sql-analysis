# 🗳️ Electoral Bond Analysis using SQL

#Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth **SQL-based analysis** of India's Electoral Bond system — a financial instrument used for political donations. Using raw CSV data and robust SQL queries, this project uncovers the **flow of money in politics**, tracks donor behavior, highlights party-wise encashments, and identifies transparency gaps in political funding.

🔍 **Key Questions Addressed:**
- Who spent the most on electoral bonds?
- Which parties received the highest donations?
- What proportion of funds remain unaccounted for?
- Which cities facilitated the most transactions?
- Which employees or bank branches were most active in handling these bonds?
